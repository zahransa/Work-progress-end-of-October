Consequently, ontology summarization, as a way to distill key information from an ontology and generate an abridged version to facilitate a better understanding, is getting growing attention. In this survey paper, we review existing ontology summarization techniques and focus mainly on graph-based methods, which represent an ontology as a graph and apply centrality-based and other measures to identify the most important elements of an ontology as its summary. After analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, we highlight a few potential directions for future research.},

abstract = {On RDF datasets, the truth values of triples are known when they are either explicitly stated or can be inferred using log-ical entailment. Due to the open world semantics of RDF, nothing can be said about the truth values of triples that are neither in the dataset nor can be logically inferred. By es-timating the truth values of such triples, one could discover new information from the database thus enabling to broaden the scope of queries to an RDF base that can be answered, support knowledge engineers in maintaining such knowledge bases or recommend users resources worth looking into for instance. In this paper, we present a new approach to pre-dict the truth values of any RDF triple. Our approach uses a 3-dimensional tensor representation of the RDF knowl-edge base and applies tensor factorization techniques that take open world semantics into account to predict new true triples given already observed ones. We report results of experiments on real world datasets comparing different ten-sor factorization models. Our empirical results indicate that our approach is highly successful in estimating triple truth values on incomplete RDF datasets.},

In this work we present an evolutionary algorithm to help with this challenging task. Given a training list of source-target node-pair examples our algorithm can learn patterns (SPARQL queries) from a SPARQL endpoint. The learned patterns can be visualised to form the basis for further investigation, or they can be used to predict target nodes for new source nodes. Amongst others, we apply our algorithm to a dataset of several hundred human associations (such as "circle - square") to find patterns for them in DBpedia. We show the scalability of the algorithm by running it against a SPARQL endpoint loaded with {\textgreater} 7.9 billion triples. Further, we use the resulting SPARQL queries to mimic human associations with a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 39.9 {\%} and a Recall@10 of 63.9 {\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a framework for learning from RDF data using graph kernels that count substructures in RDF graphs, which systematically covers most of the existing kernels previously defined and provides a number of new variants. Our definitions include fast kernel variants that are computed directly on the RDF graph. To improve the performance of these kernels we detail two strategies. The first strategy involves ignoring the vertex labels that have a low frequency among the instances. Our second strategy is to remove hubs to simplify the RDF graphs. We test our kernels in a number of classification experiments with real-world RDF datasets. Overall the kernels that count subtrees show the best performance. However, they are closely followed by simple bag of labels baseline kernels. The direct kernels substantially decrease computation time, while keeping performance the same. For the walks counting kernel this decrease in computation time is so large that it thereby becomes a computationally viable kernel to use. Ignoring low frequency labels improves the performance for all datasets. The hub removal algorithm increases performance on two out of three of our smaller datasets, but has little impact when used on our larger datasets.},

The structured data available in the semantic web have been rapidly increasing with the contribution of linked open data and other similar community initiatives in recent years.

Building a summary graph can help reduce the computational complexity and query time in semantic searches by providing an intermediate index structure which contains entity type classes and relations between them.

Often, triple-pattern queries will return too many or too few results, making it difficult for users to find relevant answers to their information needs. To remedy this, we propose a general framework for effective searching of RDF knowledge graphs. Our framework extends both the searched knowledge graph and triple-pattern queries with keywords to allow users to form a wider range of queries. In addition, it provides result ranking based on statistical machine translation, and performs automatic query relaxation to improve query recall. Finally, we also define a notion of result diversity in the setting of RDF data and provide mechanisms to diversify RDF search results using Maximal Marginal Relevance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our retrieval framework using various carefully-designed user studies on DBpedia, a large and real-world RDF knowledge graph.},

abstract = {The trade-off between language expressiveness and system scalability (E{\&}S) is a well-known problem in RDF stream reasoning. Higher expressiveness supports more complex reasoning logic, however, it may also hinder system scal-ability. Current research mainly focuses on logical frameworks suitable for stream reasoning as well as the implementation and the evaluation of prototype systems. These systems are normally developed in a centralized setting which suffer from inherent limited scalability, while an in-depth study of applying distributed so-lutions to cover E{\&}S is still missing. In this paper, we aim to explore the fea-sibility of applying modern distributed computing frameworks to meet E{\&}S all together. To do so, we first propose BigSR, a technical demonstrator that supports a positive fragment of the LARS framework. For the sake of generality and to cover a wide variety of use cases, BigSR relies on the two main execution models adopted by major distributed execution frameworks: Bulk Synchronous Process-ing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT). Accordingly, we implement BigSR on top of Apache Spark Streaming (BSP model) and Apache Flink (RAT model). In order to conclude on the impacts of BSP and RAT on E{\&}S, we analyze the ability of the two models to support distributed stream reasoning and identify several types of use cases characterized by their levels of support. This classi-fication allows for quantifying the E{\&}S trade-off by assessing the scalability of each type of use case w.r.t. its level of expressiveness. Then, we conduct a se-ries of experiments with 15 queries from 4 different datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR over both BSP and RAT generally scales up to high throughput beyond million-triples per second (with or without recursion), and RAT attains sub-millisecond delay for stateless query operators.},

@article{Fernandez2013,
abstract = {The current Web of Data is producing increasingly large RDF datasets. Massive publication efforts of RDF data driven by initiatives like the Linked Open Data movement, and the need to exchange large datasets has unveiled the drawbacks of traditional RDF representations, inspired and designed by a document-centric and human-readable Web. Among the main problems are high levels of verbosity/redundancy and weak machine-processable capabilities in the description of these datasets. This scenario calls for efficient formats for publication and exchange. This article presents a binary RDF representation addressing these issues. Based on a set of metrics that characterizes the skewed structure of real-world RDF data, we develop a proposal of an RDF representation that modularly partitions and efficiently represents three components of RDF datasets: Header information, a Dictionary, and the actual Triples structure (thus called HDT). Our experimental evaluation shows that datasets in HDT format can be compacted by more than fifteen times as compared to current naive representations, improving both parsing and processing while keeping a consistent publication scheme. Specific compression techniques over HDT further improve these compression rates and prove to outperform existing compression solutions for efficient RDF exchange. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hadi2013a,
abstract = {The Internet has fundamentally changed the way we collect, access, and deliver information. However, this now means that finding the exact information we need is a significant problem. While search engines can find information based on the keywords we provide, using this technique alone is insufficient for rich information retrieval. Consequently, solutions, which lack the understanding of the syntax and semantics of content, find it difficult to accurately access the information we need. New approaches have been proposed that try to overcome this limitation by utilising Semantic Web and Linked Data techniques. Content is serialised using RDF, and queries executed using SPARQL. This approach requires an exact match between the query structure and the RDF content. While this is an improvement to keyword-based search, there is no support for probabilistic reasoning to show how close a query is to the content being searched. In this paper, we address this limitation by converting RDF content into a matrix of features and treat queries as a classification problem. We have successfully developed a working prototype system to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of providing an order of relevance, or ranking, among entities' properties used in RDF datasets, Linked Data and SPARQL endpoints. We first motivate the importance of ranking RDF properties by providing two killer applications for the problem, namely property tagging and entity visualization. Moved by the desiderata of these applications, we propose to apply Machine Learning to Rank (MLR) techniques to the problem of ranking RDF properties. Our devised solution is based on a deep empirical study of all the dimensions involved: feature selection, MLR algorithm and Model training. The major advantages of our approach are the following: (a) flexibility/personalization, as the properties' relevance can be user-specified by personalizing the training set in a supervised approach, or set by a novel automatic classification approach based on SWiPE; (b) speed, since it can be applied without computing frequencies over the whole dataset, leveraging existing fast MLR algorithms; (c) effectiveness, as it can be applied even when no ontology data is available by using novel dataset-independent features; (d) precision, which is high both in terms of f-measure and Spearman's rho. Experimental results show that the proposed MLR framework outperform the two existing approaches found in literature which are related to RDF property ranking.},

For new questions they have to decide which datasets are suitable and in which terminology and modelling style to phrase the SPARQL query. In this work we present an evolutionary algorithm to help with this challenging task. Given a training list of source-target node-pair examples our algorithm can learn patterns (SPARQL queries) from a SPARQL endpoint. The learned patterns can be visualised to form the basis for further investigation, or they can be used to predict target nodes for new source nodes. Amongst others, we apply our algorithm to a dataset of several hundred human associations (such as "circle - square") to find patterns for them in DBpedia. We show the scalability of the algorithm by running it against a SPARQL endpoint loaded with {\textgreater} 7.9 billion triples. Further, we use the resulting SPARQL queries to mimic human associations with a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 39.9 {\%} and a Recall@10 of 63.9 {\%}.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web opens up new opportunities for the data mining research. Semantic Web data is usually represented in the RDF triple format (subject, predicate, object). Large RDF-style Knowledge Bases contain hundreds of millions of RDF triples that represent knowledge in a machine-understandable format. Association rule mining is one of the most effective techniques for detecting frequent patterns. In the context of Semantic Web data mining, most existing methods rely on users intervention that is time-consuming and error-prone due to a large amount of data. Meanwhile, rule quality factors (e.g. support and confidence) usually consider knowledge at the instance-level. Namely, these factors disregard the knowledge embedded at the schema-level. In this paper, we demonstrate that ignoring knowledge encoded at the schema-level negatively impacts the interpretation of discovered rules. We introduce an approach called SWARM (Semantic Web Association Rule Mining) that automatically mines Semantic Association Rules from RDF data. The main achievement of SWARM is to reveal common behavioural patterns associated with knowledge at the instance-level and schema-level. We discuss how to utilize knowledge encoded at the schema-level to add more semantics to the rules. We compare the semantic of rules discovered by SWRAM with one of the latest approaches in this field to show the importance of considering schema-level knowledge. Initial experiments performed on RDF-style Knowledge Bases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We start with deep syntactic analysis of the text and, for each sentence, extract logical form triples, subject–predicate–object. We then apply cross-sentence pronoun resolution, co-reference resolution, and semantic normalization to refine the set of triples and merge them into a semantic graph. This procedure is applied to both documents and corresponding summary extracts. We train linear Support Vector Machine on the logical form triples to learn how to extract triples that belong to sentences in document summaries. The classifier is then used for automatic creation of document summaries of test data. Our experiments with the DUC 2002 data show that increasing the set of attributes to include semantic properties and topological graph properties of logical triples yields statistically significant improvement of the micro-average F1 measure for the extracted summaries.

abstract = {Comparison of resources is a frequent task in different bio-informatics applications, including drug-target interaction, drug repositioning and mechanism of action understanding, among others. This paper proposes a general method for the logical comparison of resources modeled in Resource Description Framework and shows its distinguishing features with reference to the comparison of drugs. In particular, the method returns a description of the commonalities between resources, rather than a numerical value estimating their similarity and/or relatedness. The approach is domain-independent and may be flexibly adapted to heterogeneous use cases, according to a process for setting parameters which is completely explicit. The paper also presents an experiment using the dataset Bioportal as knowledge source; the experiment is fully reproducible, thanks to the elicitation of criteria and values for parameter customization.},

@article{Tekli2018,
abstract = {In the past decade, there has been an increasing need for semantic-aware data search and indexing in textual (structured and NoSQL) databases, as full-text search systems became available to non-experts where users have no knowledge about the data being searched and often formulate query keywords which are different from those used by the authors in indexing relevant documents, thus producing noisy and sometimes irrelevant results. In this paper, we address the problem of semantic-aware querying and provide a general framework for modeling and processing semantic-based keyword queries in textual databases, i.e., considering the lexical and semantic similarities/disparities when matching user query and data index terms. To do so, we design and construct a semantic-aware inverted index structure called SemIndex, extending the standard inverted index by constructing a tightly coupled inverted index graph that combines two main resources: a semantic network and a standard inverted index on a collection of textual data. We then provide a general keyword query model with specially tailored query processing algorithms built on top of SemIndex, in order to produce semantic-aware results, allowing the user to choose the results' semantic coverage and expressiveness based on her needs. To investigate the practicality and effectiveness of SemIndex, we discuss its physical design within a standard commercial RDBMS allowing to create, store, and query its graph structure, thus enabling the system to easily scale up and handle large volumes of data. We have conducted a battery of experiments to test the performance of SemIndex, evaluating its construction time, storage size, query processing time, and result quality, in comparison with legacy inverted index. Results highlight both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.},

abstract = {The generation of natural language from Resource Description Framework (RDF) data has recently gained significant attention due to the continuous growth of Linked Data. A number of these approaches generate natural language in languages other than English, however, no work has been proposed to generate Brazilian Portuguese texts out of RDF. We address this research gap by presenting RDF2PT, an approach that verbalizes RDF data to Brazilian Portuguese language. We evaluated RDF2PT in an open questionnaire with 44 native speakers divided into experts and non-experts. Our results suggest that RDF2PT is able to generate text which is similar to that generated by humans and can hence be easily understood.},

abstract = {Efficient usage of the knowledge provided by the Linked Data community is often hindered by the need for domain experts to formulate the right SPARQL queries to answer questions. For new questions they have to decide which datasets are suitable and in which terminology and modelling style to phrase the SPARQL query. In this work we present an evolutionary algorithm to help with this challenging task. Given a training list of source-target node-pair examples our algorithm can learn patterns (SPARQL queries) from a SPARQL endpoint. The learned patterns can be visualised to form the basis for further investigation, or they can be used to predict target nodes for new source nodes. Amongst others, we apply our algorithm to a dataset of several hundred human associations (such as "circle - square") to find patterns for them in DBpedia. We show the scalability of the algorithm by running it against a SPARQL endpoint loaded with {\textgreater} 7.9 billion triples. Further, we use the resulting SPARQL queries to mimic human associations with a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 39.9 {\%} and a Recall@10 of 63.9 {\%}.},

The authors found some useful information in the dataset that should be explored for judging the improvement of the search query's result. After analysis we came to know that many of the papers residing in RKBExplorer did not have keyword information. Because of that the search engine based on the RKBExplorer only able to use the information in this database going to retrieve the papers, authors of that paper and their related cited papers with given paper author or title. But assume the situation where the user wants to enter the search string, then what would be the result? Would it retrieve all the related paper even if their keywords are not assigned? In this paper we are trying to answer this question, with the help of data mining algorithm ARM on the features retrieved from the RDF data.

abstract = {Designing question answering systems requires efficient and deep analysis of natural language questions. A key process for this task is to translate the semantic relations expressed in the question into a machine-readable representation. In this paper we tackle question analysis in the medical field. More precisely, we study how to translate a natural language question into a machine-readable representation. The underlying transformation process requires determining three key points: (i) What are the main characteristics of medical questions? (ii) Which methods are the most fitted for the extraction of these characteristics? and (iii) how to translate the extracted information into a machine-understandable representation? We present a complete question analysis approach including medical entity recognition, semantic relation extraction and automatic translation to SPARQL queries. Our study supports the fact that SPARQL can represent a wide range of natural language questions in a question-answering perspective. Experiments on a corpus of real questions show that we obtain encouraging results in medical entity recognition and relation extraction. The obtained results also show that the output SPARQL queries correctly represent more than 60{\%} of the original questions.},

abstract = {Today, large amounts of data are produced by sensor networks. They are continuously producing data streams about real world phenomena. However, these data streams are generated in raw and different formats, lacking the semantics to describe their meanings, which imposes barriers to accessing and using them. To tackle this problem, several solutions using Linked Data Principles have been proposed. In this article, we survey the main solutions developed by the research communities for publishing data streams in the Web of Data. The major contributions of the article are the identification of the strengths and limitations of these solutions and, over that basis, the main steps that someone should follow to publish data streams in a manner that anyone can use them, with a minimal understanding of the details. We also highlight the main challenges that emerge from this survey, concluding with a list of research tasks for future work.},

abstract = {The accuracy of model-based reliability analysis is affected by the uncertainty regarding the model parameters used to predict the behavior of the engineering system. The uncertainty in the model parameters can be reduced by combining prior knowledge about the parameters with observed data regarding system inputs and outputs. In some cases, the information about the observations is only available as abstracted data, where the original raw data have been reduced to a summarized representation. Common forms of abstracted data include summary statistics, such as the mean and variance for continuous variables and observed frequencies for discrete variables. In the context of reliability analysis, a common form of available information is summarized reliability data for various mechanical components (e.g., failure rates or failure probabilities) instead of detailed actual test data. This paper presents a methodology for updating the model parameters using these abstracted data forms through a Bayesian network. First, the concept of a statistics function is developed and linked to the abstracted data forms. The concept of arc reversal is then exploited to transform the Bayesian network to a form that can be used to incorporate the statistics function and thereby enable the updating of the model parameters. Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the applicability and generality of the proposed method for several different forms of abstracted data.},

abstract = {Measuring the nitrogen nutrition status of plants is useful for nitrogen fertiliser management. As nitrogen is one of the main structural components of chlorophyll, its nutrition status is highly correlated with the greenness of leaves. This paper proposes and evaluates a new low-cost method to estimate the N-nutrition status of plants using digital colour image analysis. A method has been developed in which principal component analysis is applied to digital images to calculate a greenness index using RGB components of the colour image, which yields an estimate of the amount of N in the plant. To evaluate its quality, we calculated the correlation between the index and measurements obtained with a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter, normally used in decision-making in fertiliser management. The performance of the proposed index is better than that of others previously investigated. Furthermore, the capacity of our index to predict N deficiencies affecting barley yield was equal to or better than that of SPAD measurements under our experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The method was designed to be completely automatic, eliminating the possibility of human error and reducing time taken to measure disease severity. The program is capable of dealing with images containing multiple leaves, further reducing the time taken. Accurate results are possible when the symptoms and leaf veins have similar color and shade characteristics. The algorithm is subject to one constraint: the background must be as close to white or black as possible. Tests showed that the method provided accurate estimates over a wide variety of conditions, being robust to variation in size, shape, and color of leaves; symptoms; and leaf veins. Low rates of false positives and false negatives occurred due to extrinsic factors such as issues with image capture and the use of extreme file compression ratios.},

abstract = {In this paper, a procedure for segmenting and classifying scanned legume leaves based only on the analysis of their veins is proposed (leaf shape, size, texture and color are discarded). Three legume species are studied, namely soybean, red and white beans. The leaf images are acquired using a standard scanner. The segmentation is performed using the unconstrained hit-or-miss transform and adaptive thresholding. Several morphological features are computed on the segmented venation, and classified using four alternative classifiers, namely support vector machines (linear and Gaussian kernels), penalized discriminant analysis and random forests. The performance is compared to the one obtained with cleared leaves images, which require a more expensive, time consuming and delicate procedure of acquisition. The results are encouraging, showing that the proposed approach is an effective and more economic alternative solution which outperforms the manual expert's recognition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Conventional greenhouse environmental conditions are determined by observation. However, destructive or invasive contact measurements are not practical for real-time monitoring and control applications. At the canopy scale, machine vision has the potential to identify emerging stresses and guide sampling for identification of the stressor. A machine vision-guided plant sensing and monitoring system was used to detect calcium deficiency in lettuce crops grown in greenhouse conditions using temporal, color and morphological changes of the plant. The machine vision system consisted of two main components: a robotic camera positioning system and an image processing module. The machine vision system extracted plant features to determine overall plant growth and health status, including top projected canopy area (TPCA) as a morphological feature; red-green-blue (RGB) and hue-saturation-luminance (HSL) values as color features; and entropy, energy, contrast, and homogeneity as textural features. The machine vision-guided system was capable of extracting plant morphological, textural and temporal features autonomously. The methodology developed was capable of identifying calcium-deficient lettuce plants 1 day prior to visual stress detection by human vision. Of the extracted plant features, TPCA, energy, entropy, and homogeneity were the most promising markers for timely detection of calcium deficiency in the lettuce crop studied. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example.

We have established GIFT-Cloud, a data and medical image sharing platform, to meet the needs of GIFT-Surg, an international research collaboration that is developing novel imaging methods for fetal surgery. GIFT-Cloud also has general applicability to other areas of imaging research. Methods GIFT-Cloud builds upon well-established cross-platform technologies. The Server provides secure anonymised data storage, direct web-based data access and a REST API for integrating external software. The Uploader provides automated on-site anonymisation, encryption and data upload. Gateways provide a seamless process for uploading medical data from clinical systems to the research server. Results GIFT-Cloud has been implemented in a multi-centre study for fetal medicine research. We present a case study of placental segmentation for pre-operative surgical planning, showing how GIFT-Cloud underpins the research and integrates with the clinical workflow.

abstract = {One of the main problems in the post-harvest processing of citrus is the detection of visual defects in order to classify the fruit depending on their appearance. Species and cultivars of citrus present a high rate of unpredictability in texture and colour that makes it difficult to develop a general, unsupervised method able of perform this task. In this paper we study the use of a general approach that was originally developed for the detection of defects in random colour textures. It is based on a Multivariate Image Analysis strategy and uses Principal Component Analysis to extract a reference eigenspace from a matrix built by unfolding colour and spatial data from samples of defect-free peel. Test images are also unfolded and projected onto the reference eigenspace and the result is a score matrix which is used to compute defective maps based on the T2 statistic. In addition, a multiresolution scheme is introduced in the original method to speed up the process. Unlike the techniques commonly used for the detection of defects in fruits, this is an unsupervised method that only needs a few samples to be trained. It is also a simple approach that is suitable for real-time compliance. Experimental work was performed on 120 samples of oranges and mandarins from four different cultivars: Clemenules, Marisol, Fortune, and Valencia. The success ratio for the detection of individual defects was 91.5{\%}, while the classification ratio of damaged/sound samples was 94.2{\%}. These results show that the studied method can be suitable for the task of citrus inspection. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soybean rust, caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is one of the most destructive diseases for soybean production. It often causes significant yield loss and may rapidly spread from field to field through airborne urediniospores. In order to implement timely fungicide treatments for the most effective control of the disease, it is essential to detect the infection and severity of soybean rust. This research explored feasible methods for detecting soybean rust and quantifying severity. In this study, images of soybean leaves with different rust severity were collected using both a portable spectroradiometer and a multispectral CDD camera. Different forms of vegetation indices were used to investigate the possibility of detecting rust infection. Results indicated that both leaf development stage and rust infection severity changed the surface reflectance within a wide band of spectrum. In general, old leaves with most severe rust infection resulted in lowest reflectance. A difference vegetation index (DVI) showed a positive correlation with reflectance differences. However, it lacks solid evidence to identify such reflectance change was solely caused by rust. As an alternative, three parameters, i.e. ratio of infected area (RIA), lesion color index (LCI) and rust severity index (RSI), were extracted from the multispectral images and used to detect leaf infection and severity of infection. The preliminary results obtained from this laboratory-scale research demonstrated that this multispectral imaging method could quantitatively detect soybean rust. Further tests of field scale are needed to verify the effectiveness and reliability of this sensing method to detect and quantify soybean rust infection in real time field scouting.},

abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening is a bacterial infection which is spread by a citrus psyllid. No effective cure for this disease has been reported yet, and the HLB-infected tree will eventually die. Therefore, the infected tree must be detected and removed immediately to stop the spread of the disease. One of the symptoms of HLB is the accumulation of starch which creates blotchy mottles in an asymmetrical pattern on infected citrus leaves. These blotchy mottles symptoms may be confused with the deficiency of certain nutrients such as zinc or magnesium. We showed in a previous study that the unique capability of starch to rotate the polarization planar of light can be employed to identify the HLB-infected citrus leaves and differentiate them from zinc or magnesium deficiency. In this study, a vision sensor was developed for the purpose of real-time HLB detection for use under field conditions. The sensor included a highly sensitive monochrome camera, narrow band high power LEDs, and polarizing filters. The sensor was first tested and calibrated in a simulated field condition in a laboratory. Then, it was tested in a citrus grove. Two simple image descriptors; mean and standard deviation of gray values, were used for the purpose of classification. The results showed that the sensor clearly highlighted the starch accumulation in the HLB-infected leaf and differentiated it from visually analogous symptoms of zinc deficiency. HLB detection accuracies which ranged from 95.5{\%} to 98.5{\%} were achieved during the laboratory and field experiments.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper presents a survey on methods that use digital image processing techniques to detect, quantify and classify plant diseases from digital images in the visible spectrum. Although disease symptoms can manifest in any part of the plant, only methods that explore visible symptoms in leaves and stems were considered. This was done for two main reasons: to limit the length of the paper and because methods dealing with roots, seeds and fruits have some peculiarities that would warrant a specific survey. The selected proposals are divided into three classes according to their objective: detection, severity quantification, and classification. Each of those classes, in turn, are subdivided according to the main technical solution used in the algorithm. This paper is expected to be useful to researchers working both on vegetable pathology and pattern recognition, providing a comprehensive and accessible overview of this important field of research.},

@article{Oberti2014,
abstract = {Powdery mildew is a major fungal disease for grapevine ( Vitis vinifera L.) as well as for other important specialty crops, causing severe damage, including yield loss and depreciation of wine or produce quality. This disease is thoroughly controlled by uniform spraying of vineyards with agrochemicals according to a calendar, which can easily result in ten to fifteen fungicide applications in several grapevine-growing areas. Since primary infections are localized in discrete foci rather than being uniformly diffused, there are potential benefits linked to the development of systems able to detect initial infection foci and operate targeted treatments instead of the current homogenous and unselective sprayings. Proximal optical sensing is a major candidate for becoming the preferred technique for identification of foci for powdery mildew in grapevine and other specialty crops, but detection sensitivity of symptoms in the early-middle stage can yield largely limited results due to the combination of small dimensions, low density, and spatial arrangement of thin fungal structures.This study investigated how the detection sensitivity (i.e., the portion of diseased tissue correctly recognized by the system) can be improved, especially for early-middle symptoms by means of sensing measurements carried out from an angle, rather than perpendicularly to the leaf's surface. To this aim, a multispectral imaging approach was applied to 35 grapevine leaves (10 used as calibration and 25 as validation samples) that were imaged at five different view angles from 0?? (camera perpendicular to the leaf surface) up to 75??. Detection sensitivity was evaluated by applying to the validation images an algorithm based on the combination of two spectral indexes. The used algorithm was separately trained basing on the calibration set of images.Overall results indicate that detection sensitivity generally increases as the view angle is increased, with a peak value obtained for images acquired at 60??. In particular, for tissue with early-middle symptoms, the algorithm's sensitivity exhibits a dramatic improvement, from 9{\%} at 0?? up to 73{\%} at 60??.Provided that the adopted training system results in rather homogenous leaves orientation, these findings suggest that field-sensing systems for detecting initial foci of grapevine powdery mildew can achieve improved results by providing the capability of measuring the canopy from a view angle in the range of 40-60??. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Citrus canker, a bacterial disease of citrus tree leaves, causes significant damage to citrus production worldwide. Effective and fast disease detection methods must be undertaken to minimize the losses of citrus canker infection. In this paper, we present a new approach based on global features and zone-based local features to detect citrus canker from leaf images collected in field which is more difficult than the leaf images captured in labs. Firstly, an improved AdaBoost algorithm is used to select the most significant features of citrus lesions for the segmentation of the lesions from their background. Then a canker lesion descriptor is proposed which combines both color and local texture distribution of canker lesion zones suggested by plant phytopathologists. A two-level hierarchical detection structure is developed to identify canker lesions. Thirdly, we evaluate the proposed method and its comparison with other approaches, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves similar classification accuracy as human experts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Reliable, precise and accurate estimates of disease severity are important for predicting yield loss, monitoring and forecasting epidemics, for assessing crop germplasm for disease resistance, and for understanding fundamental biological processes including co-evolution. Disease assessments that are inaccurate and/or imprecise might lead to faulty conclusions being drawn from the data, which in turn can lead to incorrect actions being taken in disease management decisions. Plant disease can be quantified in several different ways. This review considers plant disease severity assessment at the scale of individual plant parts or plants, and describes our current understanding of the sources and causes of assessment error, a better understanding of which is required before improvements can be targeted. The review also considers how these can be identified using various statistical tools. Indeed, great strides have been made in the last thirty years in identifying the sources of assessment error inherent to visual rating, and this review highlights ways that assessment errors can be reducedparticularly by training raters or using assessment aids. Lesion number in relation to area infected is known to influence accuracy and precision of visual estimatesthe greater the number of lesions for a given area infected results in more overestimation. Furthermore, there is a widespread tendency to overestimate disease severity at low severities (10{\%}). Both interrater and intrarater reliability can be variable, particularly if training or rating aids are not used. During the last eighty years acceptable accuracy and precision of visual disease assessments have often been achieved using disease scales, particularly because of the time they allegedly save, and the ease with which they can be learned, but recent work suggests there can be some disadvantages to their use. This review considers new technologies that offer opportunity to assess disease with greater objectivity (reliability, precision, and accuracy). One of these, visible light photography and digital image analysis has been increasingly used over the last thirty years, as software has become more sophisticated and user-friendly. Indeed, some studies have produced very accurate estimates of disease using image analysis. In contrast, hyperspectral imagery is relatively recent and has not been widely applied in plant pathology. Nonetheless, it offers interesting and potentially discerning opportunities to assess disease. As plant disease assessment becomes better understood, it is against the backdrop of concepts of reliability, precision and accuracy (and agreement) in plant pathology and measurement science. This review briefly describes these concepts in relation to plant disease assessment. Various advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches to disease assessment are described. For each assessment method some future research priorities are identified that would be of value in better understanding the theory of disease assessment, as it applies to improving and fully realizing the potential of image analysis and hyperspectral imagery.},

abstract = {Plants exposed to stress due to pollution, disease or nutrient deficiency often develop visible symptoms on leaves such as spots, colour changes and necrotic regions. Early symptom detection is important for precision agriculture, environmental monitoring using bio-indicators and quality assessment of leafy vegetables. Leaf injury is usually assessed by visual inspection, which is labour-intensive and to a considerable extent subjective. In this study, methods for classifying individual pixels as healthy or injured from images of clover leaves exposed to the air pollutant ozone were tested and compared. RGB images of the leaves were acquired under controlled conditions in a laboratory using a standard digital SLR camera. Different feature vectors were extracted from the images by including different colour and texture (spatial) information. Four approaches to classification were evaluated: (1) Fit to a Pattern Multivariate Image Analysis (FPM) combined with T2 statistics (FPM-T2) or (2) Residual Sum of Squares statistics (FPM-RSS), (3) linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and (4) K-means clustering. The predicted leaf pixel classifications were trained from and compared to manually segmented images to evaluate classification performance. The LDA classifier outperformed the three other approaches in pixel identification with significantly higher accuracy, precision, true positive rate and F-score and significantly lower false positive rate and computation time. A feature vector of single pixel colour channel intensities was sufficient for capturing the information relevant for pixel identification. Including neighbourhood pixel information in the feature vector did not improve performance, but significantly increased the computation time. The LDA classifier was robust with 95{\%} mean accuracy, 83{\%} mean true positive rate and 2{\%} mean false positive rate, indicating that it has potential for real-time applications. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The problem associated with automatic plant disease identification using visible range images has received considerable attention in the last two decades, however the techniques proposed so far are usually limited in their scope and dependent on ideal capture conditions in order to work properly. This apparent lack of significant advancements may be partially explained by some difficult challenges posed by the subject: presence of complex backgrounds that cannot be easily separated from the region of interest (usually leaf and stem), boundaries of the symptoms often are not well defined, uncontrolled capture conditions may present characteristics that make the image analysis more difficult, certain diseases produce symptoms with a wide range of characteristics, the symptoms produced by different diseases may be very similar, and they may be present simultaneously. This paper provides an analysis of each one of those challenges, emphasizing both the problems that they may cause and how they may have potentially affected the techniques proposed in the past. Some possible solutions capable of overcoming at least some of those challenges are proposed.},

abstract = {A knowledge base is a large repository of facts that are mainly represented as RDF triples, each of which consists of a subject , a predicate (relationship), and an object. The RDF triple representation offers a simple interface for applications to access the facts. However, this representation is not in a natural language form, which is difficult for humans to understand. We address this problem by proposing a system to translate a set of RDF triples into natural sentences based on an encoder-decoder framework. To preserve as much information from RDF triples as possible, we propose a novel graph-based triple encoder. The proposed encoder encodes not only the elements of the triples but also the relationships both within a triple and between the triples. Experimental results show that the proposed en-coder achieves a consistent improvement over the baseline models by up to 17.6{\%}, 6.0{\%}, and 16.4{\%} in three common metrics BLEU, METEOR, and TER, respectively.},
